Automatically generate and save alt tags to database when images are uploaded & clientside SEO image tag optimization.

== Description ==
SEO Image Tags puts an end to ever have to worry about getting HTML validation errors and warnings due to lack of alt tags on images and media. Alt tags are dynamically generated and saved to the database automatically any time an image is uploaded, no configuration or headache required!

And for the situations where images are statically hardcoded throughout and don\'t pull alt tags into them, we got you covered. There is clientside scripting to make sure every image has all the needed attributes for SEO friendly images and websites.

== Installation ==
Either upload a .zip file, or install through the WordPress.org repository.
